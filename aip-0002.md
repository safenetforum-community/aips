## Abstract

This AIP defines an authentication mechanism that Autonomi applications can leverage. 

## Motivation

Autonomi applications uploading to the network require payment in ETH and ANT tokens.
Authentication is necessary to prevent unauthorized access, payments, and theft.
To create a cohesive application ecosystem, a standard method of authentication shared between
applications is desireable from a development and user perspective.

## Requirements

**FIXME: list requirements for this authentication system here**

**FIXME: Need a champion for this AIP**
