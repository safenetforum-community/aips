## Abstract

This AIP defines a common authentication mechanism that Autonomi applications can leverage. 

## Motivation

Autonomi applications uploading to the network require payment in ETH and ANT tokens.
Authentication is necessary to prevent unauthorized access, payments, and theft.
To create a cohesive application ecosystem, a standard method of authentication shared between
applications is desireable from a development and user perspective.

## Requirements

**FIXME: list requirements for this authentication system here**

- Autonomi account application which can be used by everyone, allows the storage of keys needed by apps on the network, and the user can give keys to specified apps, or
  start a new derivation chain for each app.
  - Could use scratchpad to store required information
  - provides an API for applications to get the key/chain needed
  - API must be cross platform with languages Autonomi API supports at a minimum: Rust, Python, JS
  - login is m of n type of key so lost login info can be recovered by accessing safely stored parts
- The authentication application must be audited
- No end application should have access to your seed phrase or master key used for derivation, less likely to be rigerously audited, reduces attack vector footprint
- Arbitrum wallet must be separate from the Autonomi authentication so that multiple payment wallets can interact with Autonomi data
  and data is not lost if the payment keys are corrupted or stolen
- Potentially add support for hardware wallet in the future, possible modified Trezor?
  - Higher barrier to adoption vs software only approach
- Role of application ID's
  - Useful for configuration data
  - Useful to reduce the attack vector size by limiting access to derived private keys by application
  - Could be a barrier to interacting with common metadata across applications
    - Need a 'common data' reserved ID?

**FIXME: Need a champion for this AIP**
