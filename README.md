# Autonomi Improvement Proposals

Welcome! This is the list of Autonomi Improvement Proposals (AIP) for improving the [Autonomi](https://autonomi.com/) network protocol, its APIs, or application standards.

People wishing to submit AIPs, first should propose their idea or document to the [Autonomi Forum](https://forum.autonomi.community/) (do _not_ assign a number, read [AIP 1](aip-0001.md) for the full process). After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving AIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having an AIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of Autonomi users and application developers.
